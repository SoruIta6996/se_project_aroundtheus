# Project 3: Around The U.S.

## Overview

Welcome to Around the U.S.! This project aims to develop an interactive web page that showcases a collection of card elements using front-end techniques. The primary features include the utilization of CSS Grid layout, card components, text overflow handling, and responsive design through media queries. The goal is to create a visually appealing and interactive page where users can add and remove their photos, photos of other users, and make a few minor adjustments to their own profile.

**Intro**

## Key Features 

### 1. CSS Grid Layout

Leveraging the power of CSS Grid, we are structuring the layout to provide a flexible and grid-based design. This ensures a responsive and dynamic arrangement of card elements on the page, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes.

### 2. Card Components

Each profile element is encapsulated within a card component. Cards not only enhance the visual organization of the content but also provide a modular structure, making it easier to manage and style individual profiles.

### 3. Text Overflow Handling

To maintain a polished appearance, we are implementing robust text overflow handling strategies. This ensures that text within the profile elements is displayed gracefully, even when it exceeds the allocated space, providing a seamless user experience.

### 4. Media Queries for Responsiveness

Ensuring a consistent and optimal user experience across devices, we are incorporating media queries. These queries dynamically adjust the layout and styling based on the user's screen size, making the page accessible and visually pleasing on both desktop and mobile devices.
